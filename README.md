# Petrophysical-Data-Analysis
Data analysis and interpretation is one of the main aspect in Oil and Gas industry\
Well logging is one of the best mathod to get subsurface data continuly with a resolution of 10-12cm\
Well logging is one of the efficient method to measure petrophysical property of geology\
I have used well logging data to interpret about the subsurface lithology




# Procedure of Analysis
At first i read the las file provided by schlumberger of the western Australia region with python programming language\
Then i plot different plots to make a overview of the geology through observation
