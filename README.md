# Petrophysical-Data-Analysis
Data analysis and interpretation is one of the main aspect in Oil and Gas industry\
Well logging is one of the best mathod to get subsurface data continuly with a resolution of 10-12cm\
Well logging is one of the efficient method to measure petrophysical property of geology\
I have used well logging data to interpret about the subsurface lithology\
For oil and gas industry porosity and permeability of the subsurface rock\
Porosity help rock to store Hydrocarbon (Oil and Gas)\
Permeability help fluid to transmit through the rock that can make a reservoir\
Mostly reservoir are made of Sandstone




# Procedure of Analysis
At first i read the las file provided by schlumberger of the western Australia region with python programming language\
Then i plot different plots to make a overview of the geology through observation
